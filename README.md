# HDPS

## Introduction

The HDPS system is a modular plug-in system intended for visualization applications.

The system consists of a compact core which handles:

* Plug-in loading and dependency resolution
* Data storage and data synchronization
* Providing a base application window.

Additionally, a complementary public library is generated which provides:

* The base classes from which all plug-ins extend
* Basic rendering and computation classes
* Graphics utility classes
* Common GUI base classes

# HDPS

## Introduction

The HDPS system is a modular plug-in system intended for visualization applications.

The system consists of a compact core which handles:

* Plug-in loading and dependency resolution
* Data storage and data synchronization
* Providing a base application window.

Additionally, a complementary public library is generated which provides:

* The base classes from which all plug-ins extend
* Basic rendering and computation classes
* Graphics utility classes
* Common GUI base classes

## Requirements

* Qt 5.13 (https://www.qt.io/download)

## Documentation
Documentation of the system is automatically generated by [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) and available [here]().

## Usage

1. Make sure Qt 5.13 is installed on your system and is added to your Path environment variable.
2. Retrieve the latest HDPS executable from [here](https://github.com/hdps/PublicWiki/releases/tag/v0.0.1)
3. Download the .zip file and extract it on your computer
4. Add a user environment variable called `HDPS_INSTALL_DIR` that points to the `HDPS` folder.
5. Continue to write your first [plugin](https://github.com/hdps/PublicWiki/wiki/Writing-your-first-Plugin)

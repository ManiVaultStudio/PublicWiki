(Version 1.0.0)

## Introduction

ManiVault Studio is a modular plug-in system intended for visualization of high-dimensional datasets. Its plugin-based nature allows for the creation of fully-customizable applications that can be tailored perfectly to your datasets.

The system consists of a compact core that provides a base application window, manages the datasets and plugin communication, as well as handle the saving and loading of projects.
<!---
Additionally, a complementary public library is generated which provides:

* The base classes from which all plug-ins extend
* Basic rendering and computation classes
* Graphics utility classes
* Common GUI base classes
-->
The rest of the functionality of the system comes from fully self-contained plug-ins. These plug-ins can extend any of the following basic plug-in types:

* **Data Plugin** - Can be extended to support custom data formats.
* **View Plugin** - Can be extended to make custom visualizations of the data.
* **Analysis Plugin** - Can be extended to perform custom analytics on the data.
* **Transformation Plugin** - Can be extended to transform the data in-place.
* **Loader/Writer Plugin** - Can be extended to import or export custom data formats.

## Requirements
* Qt 6.3 (https://www.qt.io/download)
